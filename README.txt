I write this to understand how thread work 

A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. A process can have:

One thread (single-threaded), or

Multiple threads (multi-threaded)

All threads in a process share the same memory and resources, like:

The processâ€™s code and data

File descriptors

Network connections
